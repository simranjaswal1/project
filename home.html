    A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for 
    a person's company or entertainment rather than as 
    a working animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. 
    Popular pets are often considered to have attractive/cute appearances, 
    intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets
     may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal)
      and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.
